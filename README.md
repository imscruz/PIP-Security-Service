# 🦸‍♂️ PIPSS PIP Security Service (AKA The Package Whisperer)

Hey there, security superhero! Tired of those sneaky packages plotting against your Python project? Fear not! This magical tool is here to save your code from the dark side of the pip universe! 🦹‍♂️

## 🎭 What's This Sorcery?

This isn't your grandmother's security scanner (unless your grandma is a cybersecurity expert, in which case... cool grandma! 👵). It's like having a very paranoid best friend who checks everything in your pip packages for evil stuff!

## 🎪 Features (Or as we like to call them, Superpowers)

- Scans packages faster than you can say "security vulnerability" three times fast
- Plays detective with your dependencies like a caffeinated Sherlock Holmes
- Spots bad packages like a hawk with night-vision goggles
- Kicks out dangerous packages like a bouncer at an exclusive Python club
- Writes reports so detailed, they'd make an accountant jealous

## 🎯 Our Secret Weapon Arsenal

We've got more databases than you can shake a USB stick at:

1. **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**
   - Like having the FBI for your packages (but friendlier)
   - Knows more secrets than your local gossip group
   - Has a memory better than your ex remembering your mistakes

2. **Exploit Database**
   - The "Wall of Shame" for naughty packages
   - Where bad code goes to get exposed
   - Like Twitter for security vulnerabilities, but useful

3. **PyPI Security Database**
   - The all-seeing eye of the Python world
   - Package background checker (stricter than your mom checking your friends)
   - Documentation detective agency

4. **Safety DB**
   - The neighborhood watch of the Python community
   - Keeps track of who's been bad or good (Santa approved! 🎅)

## 🎪 Requirements (The Boring But Important Stuff)

- Python 3.7+ (because we're not savages)
- pip package manager (duh!)
- Internet connection (carrier pigeons not supported... yet)

## 🎢 Installation (Don't Worry, It's Easier Than Assembly Furniture)

1. Clone this bad boy:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pip-security-checker.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the magic:
```bash
python main.py
```
## 🎯 Security Levels
- SAFE ✅: Clean as your code after code review
- HIGH RISK ⚠️: Sketchy as that one friend who never returns borrowed money
- CRITICAL 💀: Clown! These will be Exploit
